# Biography


I am a CS grad student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I work as a Research Assistant under Prof. Rama Chellappa. I recently completed an internship at Magic Leap where I worked on 3D Semantic Segmentation as a Computer Vision Intern. I was previously a Teaching Assistant for CMSC 216 under Larry Herman.

I completed my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT, Hyderabad, India in May 2018. 
I did undergrad research in Computer Vision as part of the Honors program in the Center for Visual Information Technology Lab (CVIT) under Dr P. J. Narayanan. 

I am actively looking for full time positions starting from May 2020 in the field of ML and CV.
